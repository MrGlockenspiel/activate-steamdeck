# activate-steamdeck

Port of activate-linux to the community made [SteamOS Plugin Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader).

I do not own a Steam Deck yet so there is a very good chance this will not work

## Usage
1. Install the plugin loader
2. `git clone` the repo into the `/home/deck/homebrew/plugins` folder on your Steam Deck
